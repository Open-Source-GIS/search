}

POST /index ? source=photo

\n more
  
GET /index/latest ? source=photo
{ modified: 2011-04-02T00:00:00-08:00 }

DELETE /index ? source=photo to reset

-----

each data source can receive a 'reindex' command which may DELETE its
indices, may fetch /index/latest, and then makes POSTS to /index with
its docs.

might be nice for the source to apply a version on the index (or each
of the docs inside?) and get that later, to know if it has a new
version of the docs to submit.
